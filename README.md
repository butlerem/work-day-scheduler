# Work Day Scheduler Challenge

## Description

This challenge involved creating a simple web-based daily planner designed to help employees with busy schedules effectively manage their time. 

The planner allows users to add important events to their schedule and provides visual cues to indicate past, present, and future time blocks. 

It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and used the Days.js library to work with date and time.

## Usage

When you open the daily planner, the current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar.

Below you will see time blocks for standard business hours, providing an overview of your day.

The time blocks for the current day are color-coded to provide visual cues about their status:

Past time blocks are displayed in a different color, indicating that the time has already elapsed.

The current time block is highlighted, making it easy to identify the present moment.

Future time blocks are displayed in another color, helping you plan ahead.

To add an event, simply click into the desired time block. This will allow you to enter and save the details of your event.

After entering the event, click the "Save" button for that specific time block. The text you entered will be saved in the local storage of your browser.

If you refresh the page or return to the planner at a later time, your saved events will persist, ensuring you have access to your schedule.
